# customer-churn-analysis (SQL Server + Power BI + Machine Learning)
## Description
Customer churn is a significant challenge in the industry, leading to revenue loss and increased costs for acquiring new customers. By analyzing customer profiles and churn data, telecom companies can better understand the reasons behind customer departures and develop strategies to retain customers. This study aims to leverage data analytics to identify key drivers of churn, enabling proactive measures to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
I used SQL Server Management Studio 2.0 to set up a database to handle data for ETL processes. Then, Power BI- for an in-depth analysis of customer churn patterns and facilitated strategic decision-making via visualizations on dashboard. Finally, I leveraged the cutting edge machine learning technology to predict the future churners for the telecom industry and then again visualized the results on Power BI dashboard to gain insights.
### Prerequisites
I have used the following:
- SQL Server Management Studio 2.0
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook (Machine Learning)
